<h2><a name="Changes">Changes</a></h2>

<h3><a name="Changes_4.1.5">4.1.5</a> - GA Release (Scheduling)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented scheduling support.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Changes_4.0.32">4.0.32 - Hotfix</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>HTTP-PORT metadata now being registered for System asset.</li>
<li>Tracking of lamp hours, display usage and disc transport runtime will now properly start/stop based on the power state of the device. This resolves xTrack issue 506744.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Changes_4.0.31">4.0.31 - GA Release</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Power Distribution Unit monitor now reports correct energy usage.</li>
<li>Power Distribution Unit monitor now reports energy in kWh (previous reported in Wh).</li>
<li>NetLinx Document Camera monitor now properly tracking upper and lower light hours.</li>
<li>NetLinx Light System monitor now registers the asset type as a "Light System".</li>
<li>NetLinx Video Projector monitor now properly tracking lamp consumption time.</li>
<li>Input Source parameter enumeration values and control method arguments will now be represented by their logical groupings rather than their individual inputs.</li>
<li>NetLinx monitors with a Volume component previous registered a control method named "Set Volume Mute"; this has now been renamed to "Volume Mute".</li>
<li>Controls on the RMS touch panel pages have been updated so that they're more consistent with one another.</li>
<li>About RMS window on the RMS touch panel pages updated to always display the correct version.</li>
<li>The Asset Online parameter state will now properly reflect the state of the SNAPI channel 251 (DEVICE_COMMUNICATING).</li>
<li>NetLinx monitors updated to be more consistent with Duet monitors; Device Data Initialized parameter will now be registered with RMS; SNAPI channel 252(DATA_INITIALIZED) will now need to be turned to ON before the device will become registered.</li>
<li>System Asset will now show the correct serial number.</li>
<li>Corrected the RMSAnterusRFIDAdapter so that exceptions are not thrown when RFID tracking is disabled.</li>
<li>Fixed logic that writes the rms.properties file to the "user" directory so that no exception occurs when RMS code is loaded for the first time.</li>
<li>Added retry logic to make the registration process with the server more robust.</li>
<li>Implemented optimizations to allow for greater scalability on the RMS server.</li>
